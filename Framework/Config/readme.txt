Running generator.php results in a JSON file with the same format as config_sample.json.
In case of any error in connection with the execution of the script the configuration can
also be done manually following the structure of config_sample.json.

In case of permission-related issues try providing the widest permission for the whole project folder:
chmod -R 777 my-project-folder
